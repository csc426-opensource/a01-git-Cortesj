# Learning Outcome

I previously used Github for my capstone and a variety of other projects such as that for my Co-op. I think I am fairly used to Github and its innerworkings from forking, to branching, etc. I didn't know about the Profile README if you create a personal repo of similar username. I think I have gone out of practice for a bit since there was no real reason to utilize github for the past few months. I hopefully will be able to utilize git CMD more since I am extremely out of practive in-terms of git CMD.
